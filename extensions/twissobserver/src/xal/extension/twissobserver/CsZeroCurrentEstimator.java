     * from the given data at the given device location.  This is a least-squares reconstruction 
     * of the CS parameters using the given data.  
     * This is the set of second-order moments of the beam distribution.  Since the
     * measurement data cannot show coupling between phase planes, the covariance matrix is
     * block diagonal where the 2&times;2 blocks correspond to each independent phase plane
     * (see <code>{@link CorrelationMatrix}</code>).  If the measurement data is zero
     * for any phase plane, then the diagonal block corresponding to that phase plane is also zero.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The second-order moments are computed from and <i>observation matrix</i> which, in the zero
     * current case, is independent of the initial state of the beam.  The observation matrix
     * relates the initial state (described by the second moments) to the observed quantities, in this
     * case the measurement data of RMS beam sizes.  For each phase plane: In the case were there are 
     * more data points than there are variables (i.e., greater than 3) 
     * then the returned solution is the least-squares solution; specifically, the set 
     * of moments that hits the most data.  In the case
     * where there are less data points than variables (i.e., less than 3) then the returned solution is
     * the minimum norm (or "least energy") solution; specifically, the solution that has the smallest
     * Lebesgue 2-norm.  If we have 3 data points for the phase plane then the unique solution is returned.
