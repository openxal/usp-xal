  Provides a framework for building document based applications that use XAL's 
accelerator architecture.  It extends the generic application framework as a 
theme to provide an accelerator menu from which the user can load an 
accelerator definition file by either navigating to it or loading the default
file.  Then the user gets a list of accelerator sequences under the accelerator 
menu from which they can choose a sequence or create and choose a combo sequence.
Each document holds an instance of its selected accelerator and sequence.
<p>
The accelerator application framework can be used just like the generic framework
except that your document should extend AcceleratorDocument and your main window
should extend AcceleratorWindow.
