These scripts test the online model against other established optics engines.

Description of Tests:

Test Ring online model against MAD with no kicks:
type "jython ring-model-test.py" and visually check consistency.

Test Ring online model against MAD with horizontal and vertical orbit distortions:
type "jython ring-model-test.py kicks" and visually check consistency.

Test Ring online model turn by turn motion for a particle with an initial offset from the closed orbit.
type "jython ring-turns-test.py" and visually verify that the turn-by-turn motion is stable and oscillates about the closed orbit.
