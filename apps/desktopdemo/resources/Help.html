<a name="intro_ref" <b>Introduction:</b></a>
<p>
This application was developed for the purpose of demonstrating how to build
a desktop application using the application framework.  This application is a simple plain text
editor.  It demonstrates how to build a simple document based desktop application but 
does not demonstrate all of the features available in the framework.
</p>

<a name="features" <b>Features and Tips:</b></a>
<p>
This demo application is not intended to be a full featured text editor.  Rather, it
is intended to demonstrate how to build an application using the application framework.
This application is a simple plain text editor.  You can edit text in a document and save
it to a file.  You can have multiple documents open at the same time.  The application 
framework provides most of the functionality for free.  The demo application implements 
very little code.  Some of the features are for demo purposes only and don't do anything 
of particular value.  A "Special" menu is implemented to demonstrate 
how to customize the menubar and implement menu item actions.  Additionally, each document has a
menu bar with a single menu.  This is an optional feature.  Many applications will probably not have 
menus in the document window.  The desktop menubar will likely suffice.

Note how the desktop menu also changes to reflect the currently selected document status.

<li> Launch the application.
<li> You can edit the empty document or open an existing document and edit it.
