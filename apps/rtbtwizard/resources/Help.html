<h1><a name="top">RTBTWizard</a></h1>
     
<h3>Abstract:</h3>
   This program determines the beam size, position, and peak density on the target. It additionatlly allows database entry of these parameters and other important target parameters.
<br>
<br>    

 
<h3><a name="position">Introduction</a></h3>
   The application's frame is divided into a tabbed content pane. The tabs are labeled 
<a href="#position">Beam Position Tracking</a>, 
<a href="#size">Beam Size Tracking</a>,
<a href="#profile">Profile Analysis Tool</a>,
<a href="#density">Peak Density Prediction</a> and 
<a href="#database">Target Beam Achive</a>. 
 <br>
The following instructions for each tab together represent a cheat-sheet on how to use this application to tune the beam up on the target.  
 <br>
 <br>

<h3><a name="position"></a>Beam Position Tracking</h3>
1) Make sure all BPMs are timed in and working.
<br>
<br>
2) Flatten the trajectory in the RTBT.
<br>
<br>
3)     On the RTBT Wizard application, go to the 'Beam Orbit Matching' Tab.   Click on the 'Start' button on the bottom of the screen.  Watch the 'X Mean Position' and 'Y Mean Position' columns in the table.  Once these numbers settle out, click 'Stop'. De-select any BPMs with large errors (> 0.2). Then click 'Match'. The position prediction will show up on the bottom left of the screen.  You can view the projected beam position at the target along with error bars relative to the target beam  position tolerance in the accompanying plot.  
<br>
<br>
4)     Re-steer the beam using corrector DCH(V)28 .  If this corrector does not give enough leverage, then use DCH(V)23.  Iterate until the position is within the tolerance.
 <br>
 <br>


<h3><a name="size"></a>Beam Size Tracking</h3>
1)     Take RTBT wirescan data and export it using the wirescan app.  On the wirescan app, make sure you also 'Export Harp Data'.
 <br>
 <br>
2)     Open RTBT wizard.  Go to the <a name="profile"></a>'Profile Analysis tab'.  Open the exported wire file, and the exported harp data file (extensions *txt and *harp)
 <br>
 <br>
3)     Fit the profiles with either the Gaussian Fit button or the Statistical Fit button to get the RMS, and click the 'Store' button for each fit.  Be careful with Statistical Fit button, as it is sensitive to noise and fails on negative data points - eliminate any noisy floors or negative points on the wires before doing the Statistical RMS calculation.  You can use the 'V Cut Below' button to do this.
 <br>
 <br>
4)     Go to the 'Beam Size Tracking' tab and click the 'Load Fits' button.  Change the solve time to whatever your preference is (30 seconds is usually sufficient).  Start the solver.  If your fits are reasonable, it should solve the problem and populate the results tables.
 <br>
 <br>
5)     Send the beam size ratios to the harp EDM by clicking on the 'Send Results to Harp' button.
 <br>
 <br>


<h3><a name="density"></a>Peak Density Prediction</h3>
1)     First, it is necessary to have completed the above procedure in order to get a good fit for the beam size.
 <br>
 <br>
2)     If you fit the profiles with the Statistical RMS, then you will need to go back to the 'Profile Analysis' tab and refit all the profiles with the Gaussian fit. 
 <br>
 <br>
3)     Finally, go to the 'Peak Density Prediction' tab.   Click the 'Load Fitted Profiles' tab.  Then get the charge from the 'Get BCM Charge' button.  Click the 'Find Peak Density' button. 
<br>
<br>


<h3><a name="database"></a>Target Beam Archive</h3>
1)     Go to the 'Target Beam Archive' tab.  Click the 'Publish' button. 
 <br>
 <br>
2)     Fill out/modify any fields as needed, and enter your badge number.
 <br>
 <br>
3)     Publish your entry.
