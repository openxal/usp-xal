<a name="intro_ref" <b>Introduction:</b></a>
<p>
The Demo application was developed for the purpose of demonstrating how to build
an application using the application framework.  The Demo is a simple plain text
editor.  It demonstrates how to build a simple document based application but 
does not demonstrate all of the features available in the framework.
</p>

<a name="features" <b>Features and Tips:</b></a>
<p>
This demo application is not intended to be a full featured text editor.  Rather, it
is intended to demonstrate how to build an application using the application framework.
This application is a simple plain text editor.  You can edit text in a document and save
it to a file.  You can have multiple documents open at the same time.  The application 
framework provides most of the functionality for free.  The demo application implements 
very little code.  Some of the features are for demo purposes only and don't do anything 
of particular value.  For example a preference dialog is implemented that changes the 
background color of the text editor.  A "Special" menu is implemented to demonstrate 
how to customize the menubar and implement menu item actions whose enable states
are dynamically updated to reflect the model state.

<p>
The basic steps for starting the application:
<ol>
<li> Launch the application.
<li> You can edit the empty document or open an existing document and edit it.
<li> You can save your changes to a file.
<li> You can play with the different menu items to see how they behave.
</ol>
