   This application provides an efficient means for calculating extraction kicker settings in order to direct the beam to a particular position at the extraction septum.

<hr><br>
  <b>Operation:</b><br>
  The primary display table provides the name, set voltage, B field value, trial B field value, usage, solver usage, and upper and lower B field limits.  All B field values may be displayed as set values or readback values
  depending on user selection near the lower right corner of the main table.  At any point, the table may be reset to its state upon start up by clicking the button in the lower left corner of the display.  Set B field values
  may be copied into the trial column for user editing of B field trial settings.  The "In Use?" column provides the user the ability to disable corresponding extraction kickers.  The "Vary?" column allows the user to select which 
  extraction kickers to use as variables for the solver.  The single pass portion of the display allows the user to view the resulting vertical position and momentum for the either of the two sets of B field values displayed in 
  the main table.  The solver portion allows the user to set goals for position and momentum and an upper limit on allowed solve time.  Pressing the "Solve" button will vary the selected kickers in an attempt to match the goals 
  provided.  The position and momentum of the best solution will be displayed in the corresponding fields below the "Solve" button, and the magnet fields used to acheive these values will be displayed in the small table, as well 
  as the primary table.
