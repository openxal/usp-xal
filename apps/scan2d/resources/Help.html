<a name="intro_ref"><b>Introduction:</b></a>
<p> The Demo application was developed for the purpose of demonstrating
how
to build an application using the application framework. The Demo is a
simple
plain text editor. It demonstrates how to build a simple document based
application but does not demonstrate all of the features available in
the
framework. </p>

<a name="features"><b>Features and Tips:</b></a>
<p> This demo application is not intended to be a full featured text
editor. Rather, it is intended to demonstrate how to build an
application using
the application framework. This application is a simple plain text
editor. You can edit text in a document and save it to a file. You can
have multiple
documents open at the same time. The application framework provides
most
of the functionality for free. The demo application implements very
little
code. Some of the features are for demo purposes only and don't do
anything of particular value. For example a preference dialog is
implemented that
changes the background color of the text editor. A "Special" menu is
implemented
to demonstrate how to customize the menubar and implement menu item
actions
whose enable states are dynamically updated to reflect the model state.

  <li> You can edit the empty document or open an existing document and
edit
it. </li>
  <li> You can save your changes to a file. </li>
  <li> You can play with the different menu items to see how they
behave.<br>
