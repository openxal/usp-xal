<h2>XYZ Correlator</h2>
<p>XYZ Correlator plots correlations between process variables. If you enter and enable two PVs then it plots the time correlated values versus each other. If you enter and enable three PVs, then it plots the time correlated values of the first two channels against each other and sets the color of each point to correspond to the time correlated value of the third channel. A color scale is provided to indicate the mapping of the third channel values to color.</p>

<h3>Entering PVs</h3>
<p>You can enter PVs manually by either typing them into the PV table cells or by dropping the PV text onto a PV table row. You can also add channels from the XAL optics for the selected accelerator sequence by typing pressing the "Add..." button and selecting one or more channels to add. By default, there are three rows for PVs. You can add more rows if you want and check only those PVs you wish to correlate at any time.</p>

<h3>Plotting Correlations</h3>
<p>The correlator will only plot correlated values for either two or three channels marked for plotting. You can perform a polynomial fit on the 2D plotted points and copy the fit to the clipboard if you want.</p>

<h3>Monitoring Correlations</h3>
<p>You can monitor an arbitrary number of channels for correlations and you can export the correlation buffer to a text file.</p>
