<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The wirescan application was
created to automate the task of running a wirescanner and collecting
data from it.  This application allows for a user to run any number
of wirescanners in either a series or parallel fashion, view the
results on plots and data tables, save the setup of the scan, and
export the data to a standard ASCII text file.</P>
<H6 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Starting a scan|outline"></A>Starting a
scan</H6>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To begin a scan the
accelerator must be chosen, in most cases this would be the default
accelerator option.  Once the accelerator file has loaded, select the
sequence you want to access wirescanners in.  A single sequence can
be chosen or multiple, however if multiple sequences are chosen, they
must be adjacent to one another.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A table will appear with a
list of selectible wirescanners once the sequence(s) have been
chosen.  The table will list the wirescanner's name, a checkbox to
toggle whether or not to perform a scan with the wirescanner, and a
progress bar to show the current progress of the scan.  A select all
button has been provided for convienence.  A typical progress of a
wirescanner will move the progress bar to the end and then retract
the bar back to it's original position, thus emulating the
wirescanner's physical progress.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Once the selection(s) have
been made for the wirescanners to run, next choose the type of scan
to perform.  The options are series, which will run each wirescanner
in sequential order with one finishing and then the next starting, or
parallel, which will run all selected wirescanners together at the
same time.  The Start Scan button will being the scanning process.</P>
<H6 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Scanning Operation|outline"></A>Scanning
Operation</H6>
<P>Each wirescanner's scan data will be displayed on individual tabs.
 The tabbed windows include a chart displaying the current data and
will plot fitted data once the scan is complete, a table with all
post scan data, the current status, the current position, a button to
view the chart in logarithmic scale, and an abort button to abort the
individual scan.  On the main page there is an Abort All button which
will abort the entire scanning process.  The table on the main window
will show the wirescanner's progress in the last column.  After each
individual wirescanner is complete, the data table will update with
the post data and the chart will plot the fitted data.</P>
<H6 CLASS="western"><A NAME="Saving a scan setup &amp; scan data|outline"></A>
Saving a scan setup &amp; scan data</H6>
<P>To save the setup, which includes the accelerator file selected,
sequence(s), wirescanner(s), and type of scan, open the File menu and
chose the Save As option.  Type in the desired file name and include
the .wss extension on the end.  To restore the setup, start the
application and from the File menu choose Open or the Open Recent
option and chose the desired file and the setup will be restored.</P>
<P>Once all wirescanners are complete, the Export Data button can be
used on the main page to export data from all wirescanners to a
standard ASCII text file for post scan viewing.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This application was written
primarily by Steven C. Bunch with contributions from John Galambos,
Tom Pelaia, Paul Chu, and lots of good feedback from the accelerator
operators.</P>
