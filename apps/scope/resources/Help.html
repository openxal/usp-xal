<a name="intro_ref" <b>Introduction:</b></a>
<p>
The Scope application is intended to be a virtual scope capable of displaying 
waveform PVs on a common timebase relative to cycle start.
</p>

<hr><br>
<a name="release_notes" <b>Release Notes:</b></a>
<p>
Note that this application has only been tested by
the developer and hence has not been subjected to extensive quality control.
</p>
<p>
The Scope Application was developed and tested on Linux using 
version 1.4.2 of the Java runtime environment from Sun Microsystems.  Thus, it is
recommended to use this version of the Java runtime environment
on the system where this application will be running.
</p>

<hr><br>
<a name="features" <b>Features and Tips:</b></a>
<p>
Before using the application it may prove helpful to familiarize yourself
with some of the features of the Scope application.
</p>
<p>
This application can be used to view PV waveforms that provide information about 
the time offset from cycle start of each element in the waveform.  The packaging 
of This information must conform to the SNS standard.  Namely for given waveform
PVs such as <code>Physics_Test:Scope:ch1</code>, <code>Physics_Test:Scope:ch2</code>, 
<code>Physics_Test:Scope:ch3</code>
that share a common prefix, there must also be PVs which broadcast concurrently
(same time stamp) that provide information about the offset from cycle start of 
the first element in the waveform (<code>Physics_Test:Scope:tDelayTBT</code>) and the spacing 
between elements of the waveform (<code>Physics_Test:Scope:tSamplePeriod</code>).  These suffixes
(<code>tDelayTBT</code> and <code>tSamplePeriod</code>) are the accepted SNS standard suffixes.  All times 
are specified in units of turns.  By adhering to the standard, PV waveforms provided by
different groups at SNS can be displayed and aligned using a common time base.
</p>
<p>
The scope application was developed using the standard XAL application framework 
so it shares many of the common menu items and behaviors of other XAL applications.
This application is intended to be an virtual scope so hopefully the controls 
are intuitive.
</p>
<p>
Each document represents a single scope.  Under one application you may open as many
scopes as you want and performance constraints allow.  If you save a document to a 
file it should end with the suffix <code>.scope</code> as in <code>rf.scope</code>.
You many enter up to four channels (waveform PVs) to monitor.  A scope document
records the channels selected along with the settings for the channels, trigger, time base 
and the scope screen.  Essentially a document stores a scope setup.
</p>
<p>
By default when you enter channel PVs, the scope triggers on those channels.  The screen
refreshes at a fixed rate and posts the subset of waveforms that post within a 10 msec 
time window of each other.  One may also add an explicit trigger that.  This can be any PV 
and the waveforms are only displayed if the trigger posts in synchronization with a subset
of the waveforms.  Additionally one can apply a filter to the trigger PV so it will only 
trigger if the PV not only posts but also passes the filter's test (e.g. max value, min value, ...).
</p>
<p>
One may also perform simple math on the channels.  There are math channels that allow
you to enter simple math formulas that can be applied to the input channels and the math
channels output the resulting waveform that gets displayed on the scope screen.  The input
channels can be referenced as variables and their names are of the form "ch1, ch2, ..."
corresponding to the names on the buttons and in lower case.  All of the basic arithmetic
operators, "+,-,*/", are supported as well as several basic math functions, "abs, sqrt, log, 
sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, pow, min, max".  Most of these functions operate
on a single argument.  The "pow" function operates one two arguments, base and power, as
in <code>pow(ch1, 2)</code> for example to take the square of the first channel waveform.  
The "min" and "max" functions can have two or more arguments as in 
<code>min(ch1, 2.3*ch2, ch3)</code>.  A formula is evaluated over each channel input
waveform for each time point from the set of time points within the range of overlapping 
time domains of the input channels.  Interpolation is used to get values from the input
waveforms at time points where no data is available.  Here are some sample formulae:
<ul>
<li> <code>ch1 - ch2</code>
<li> <code>ch1+ ch2 + ch3</code>
<li> <code>ch1 * (ch2 - ch3) + 2.5*sin(ch4/2)</code>
<li> <code>3 + max(abs(ch1), ch2/5, ch3, 2*ch4)</code>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
For each individual input channel you may:
<ul>
<li> enable/disable the channel
<li> change the vertical units per division
<li> vertically offset the waveform
</ul>
For each individual math channel you may:
<ul>
<li> enable/disable the math channel
<li> set a formula to apply to the input channels
</ul>
For the trigger you may:
<ul>
<li> set a trigger channel
<li> enable/disable the trigger
<li> select a filter and set its parameters
</ul>
For the time base you may:
<ul>
<li> horizontally offset the time base origin from cycle start
<li> change the turns per division scale
</ul>
For the scope screen you may:
<ul>
<li> change the background brightness (shade of gray)
<li> enable/disable the grid
<li> save an image of the scope screen
<li> save the latest raw waveform data to a file
</ul>
</p>

<a name="startup_ref" <b>Start the Application:</b></a>
<p>
The basic steps for starting the application:
<ol>
<li> Make sure the latest version of xal.jar is in your Java classpath
<li> Launch the application: <code> java -server xal.app.scope.ControlApp </code>
<li> The following Java properties may optionally be set:
<table border=1>
<tr> <th> Property </th> <th> Default </th> <th>Definition</th> </tr>
<tr> <td> usesConsole </td> <td align=right> true </td> <td> True implies standard out and err should be captured by the Console instead of the command line. </td> </tr>
</table>
<li> You may either open an existing scope document or start setting up the empty scope document.
<li> To add a new channel simply select a channel button and enter the full PV name of the waveform and hit the <em>Set</em> button.
<li> To add a trigger simply select the trigger button and enter the full name of the trigger PV and hit the <em>Set</em> button.
</ol>
