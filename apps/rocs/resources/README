Also, file has been modified to reduce grid size from natural
chromaticity for (6.23, 6.20) to zero chromaticity, because sextupole
strengths are unipolar.  To prevent sign changes in strenghts, some
strengths which were very close to zero on the edges of the grid (near
the natural chromaticity) were set to zero.  Original grid that this
file came from with all MAD results is named Chrom_623_620_original.
